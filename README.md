## About application
This application was created to simplify your products management routine. It lets you add new products to your list and then,
if needed, **modify quantity** of your products or just **delete** them. Products are **sorted by expire date**, so it is really easy to check
whether your products are eatable or not :)

## Technologies used
This application uses **Room Database** as a storage of products list. I also used **Lombok** in Room entity class and **rxjava** for database operations.
